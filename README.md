# Customer-Segmentation--Unsupervised-Kmeans Clustering

## Problem Statement : 
* Let's say we have a product that we want to sell in a mall, but we dont have any idea who to target, what kind of customers we need to give our attention to ..etc?
But, we have some cusomer data that has certain information on their behaviour.
But, what can we analyse from it?

* ANS: Cluster them into groups and then analyse the groups individually to check their behaviour.

* We will use machine learning algorithms to analyse data and and this project will show you how to cluster customers on segments based on 
their behavior using the K-Means algorithm in Python.

## Let's begin:
### Let's take a look at our dataset.
